Template Giveaway is a free landing page for launching your your next startup! It's packed with [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com), [Travis Neilson's DevTips StarterKit](https://github.com/DevTips/DevTips-Starter-Kit) and [Zell Liew's Gulp](http://zellwk.com/blog/gulp-tutorial/) goodness.

## Quick start

How To Use:

1.  Clone the git repo â€” `https://github.com/r4in/template-giveaway/`

2.  Install all node dependencies with `npm install --save-dev`. I'm using Gulp as my primary task runner for autotomating stuff around.

3.  All source files are the the app folder. This will be your workspace and to begin, open the terminal and `gulp watch` to activate sass & livereload.

4.  To prepare your code for deployment, run `gulp build` to export everything to the dist folder.
